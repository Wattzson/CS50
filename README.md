# CS50

## Introduction to Computer Science - https://cs50.harvard.edu/. 

This year I am attending the online course to CS50, an Introduction to Computer Science course taught by David J. Malan.  A large portion of the course consists of projects compiled in 'C' using a customized version of cloud9 with custom libraries to make learning easier.  I am uploading my completed projects in their raw .c files to this repo, but I also plan to convert these projects to javascript in order to be able to run in a modern web browser.
